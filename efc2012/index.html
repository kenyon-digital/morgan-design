				<h1>Dear Fellow Shareholders</h1>
				<p>On behalf of the entire Ellington team, it is my pleasure to address you once again in our Annual Report to Shareholders, all the more so after our strong performance in 2012. These are exciting times for the U.S. mortgage markets, and we are enthusiastic about the opportunity set we see at Ellington Financial in these evolving markets.</p>
				<p> <span class="highlight">While our most important achievement in 2012 was generating return on equity in excess of 22%, the year was also marked by other meaningful and positive events for us.</span> In August, we completed our first secondary share offering since our October 2010 initial public offering. With this secondary offering, we not only increased our capital base
					by over 20%, but we lowered our expense ratio by roughly 20 basis points per year, and we increased the liquidity of our shares and our overall visibility to the investing public. The effect on the liquidity of our shares has been dramatic: Our average daily trading volume for the last five months of the year was roughly triple that of the first seven months of the year. The effect on our visibility has been equally tangible: Before our secondary offering, we had one sell-side analyst covering us; by year-end, we had six. As a result, we believe that our strategy, which is somewhat differentiated from the strategies of those specialty finance companies that are structured as REITs, has become more widely understood and recognized as an alternative way for investors to gain exposure to the U.S. mortgage markets.</p>
				<p>We also were pleased to have paid a special dividend for
					the 2012 year of $0.75 per share and to have increased our quarterly dividend by 10% to $0.77 per share. These actions were not only the result of our strong 2012 performance, but also reflect confidence in our ongoing outlook and prospects.</p>
				<p> <span class="highlight">It was particularly gratifying in 2012 to see <em>both</em> of our core strategies — our non-Agency MBS strategy and our Agency RMBS strategy — perform exceptionally well.</span> Reflecting our constructive view going into 2012 on the prospects of non-Agency MBS, we entered the year with a non-Agency MBS portfolio that was significantly larger relative to our capital base, was more concentrated in the distressed 2005–2007 vintages, and was less hedged from a credit risk perspective. Non-Agency MBS rallied throughout the year, but we did not just ride the rising tide. We actively repositioned the portfolio by continuing to sell higher-priced securities and by reinvesting the proceeds in lower-priced, more housing-sensitive securities where we saw greater value. These maneuvers added significantly to our performance
					in 2012.</p>
				<p>Within our Agency RMBS strategy, thanks in large part to our considerable emphasis on research and analytics, we have been very successful at identifying and acquiring pools with undervalued prepayment protection characteristics, all the while controlling our interest rate risk and, to a large extent, our prepayment risk through the aggressive use of interest rate swaps and short TBA positions.</p>
				<p> <span class="highlight">Looking ahead to 2013, active trading in our core strategies will be an even more important factor in our ability to deliver excess returns.</span> We also intend to diversify into other sectors, such as asset-backed securities and whole mortgage loans. Commercial real estate debt instruments will likely comprise a larger percentage of our deployed capital as compared to previous years. In the longer term, as the securitization market continues to heal and as the government actively seeks to reduce its footprint on the mortgage markets, our ability to efficiently (but intelligently) take risk on newly originated mortgages will be a key factor in our ability to generate new and sustainable income streams. In any case, our goal remains the same: delivering attractive returns and dividends to shareholders over time without taking outsized risks. At Ellington Financial we seek to capture upside in good markets and control downside in rough markets. Now in our sixth year of operation, I am proud to say that I feel we have accomplished this each and every year to date. </p>
				<p>Thank you for your continued support and confidence. We look forward to a successful 2013.</p>
				<p> Sincerely,<br />
