				<h3>Fellow Shareholders:</h3>

<p class="large">Reflecting on my first year as President and CEO of Endo International, I am truly proud of the accomplishments and successes
  we have achieved in creating a new Endo, one engineered for growth in 2014 and beyond. 2013 was a year of exciting
  opportunity and purposeful change for the company. I am humbled by the focus, flexibility and resilience demonstrated
  by everyone at Endo who helped forge a new path forward – one that will improve the lives of the patients we serve while
  creating value for the people who invest in our future. On that note, I want to express my sincere appreciation to all of Endo's
  shareholders for their support throughout this year&nbsp;of&nbsp;change. </p>
<h3>A New Path Forward</h3>

<p>In June 2013, we changed course when, after a thorough corporate assessment, we introduced a clear and focused new
  strategy for Endo. From this, we established five core tenets for&nbsp;the&nbsp;company:</p>
<ul>
  <li><em>Aspiration</em> to be a leading specialty healthcare company</li>
  <li><em>Shift</em> in focus from integrated health solutions to maximizing the value of each of our core businesses</li>
  <li><em>Reaffirmation</em> of our commitment to serving patients and customers</li>
  <li><em>Participation</em> in specialty areas offering above average growth and favorable margins</li>
  <li><em>Transformation</em> of our operating model to maximize growth potential and cash flow generation</li>
</ul>
<p> The strategy change was designed to better position Endo to adapt to market dynamics and portfolio changes with greater
  agility and flexibility, thereby maximizing shareholder value. With the strategy set, we immediately implemented a new
  leaner operating model. Through a corporate restructure, we created greater efficiencies, significantly reduced our
  operating expenses, and increased our financial flexibility to support organic growth within each of our business units. More
  importantly, we removed redundancies within our structure, which empowered our business units to make decisions more
  closely aligned with their&nbsp;customers'&nbsp;needs. </p>
<p> Additionally, we aligned our performance metrics with shareholder interests, focused our research and development efforts on lower-risk programs, and streamlined the organization, which has improved the efficiency of our decision making. Moreover, we remained
  focused in specialty areas and believe we can selectively expand the therapeutic categories we serve. As a final implication of
  our new strategy, we embarked on building the business for the long term through focused and disciplined acquisitions, with
  a goal of completing two to three value-creating transactions within 12-18 months of our change&nbsp;in&nbsp;direction. </p>
<h3> Value Through Focused Acquisitions and Growth</h3>
<p> In the third quarter, we announced the acquisition of Boca Pharmacal, a specialty generics company with a unique product
  portfolio and complementary pipeline that provides Endo with additional growth opportunities and builds on the strength
  of our growing generic pharmaceuticals business. We then announced the transformational acquisition of Paladin Labs &ndash; a
  Canada-based specialty pharmaceutical company focused on acquiring and in-licensing innovative medicines for Canada and
  select international markets. Paladin's strong track record of profitable growth, broad product portfolio, and its international
  geographic presence, including access to Canada and attractive emerging markets like South Africa and Mexico, made it an
  ideal fit to&nbsp;Endo's&nbsp;business.</p>
<p> The Paladin transaction accelerated Endo's transformation into a leading specialty healthcare company, and enabled the
  company to re-domicile as an Irish public limited company (plc) – a key pillar of our platform to facilitate future growth. As
  a result, Endo established new global headquarters in Dublin, Ireland. This new platform, combined with the organic growth
  potential for our businesses, along with our focused operating model, have enhanced cash flow generation, and expanded the
  opportunity for Endo to strategically grow through acquisitions on a&nbsp;global&nbsp;scale. </p>
<h3>2013 Business Results</h3>
<p> While we implemented our new strategy for growth, our company delivered solid results in 2013. Endo reported $2.6 billion
  in sales and we exceeded our internal financial expectations that were developed in conjunction with our strategic review.
  Each of our businesses also outperformed our expectations. Following are some of the key highlights: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Endo Pharmaceuticals, our branded pharmaceuticals business, reorganized its operating model, resulting in a meaningful
    reduction in its cost base while improving focus, efficiency and agility, and driving 17% product revenue growth versus
    2012 for our core set of promoted brands. This core set of products excludes results from Lidoderm&reg; (lidocaine patch
    5%) and Opana&reg; ER (oxymorphone hydrochloride), both of which faced competitive generic launches in 2013. In mid-
    2013, we believed that Opana&reg; ER could face significant near-term sales erosion due to generic competition, but are now
    more optimistic that it remains a viable opportunity for the longer-term. As a result, the business continued to provide
    Opana&reg; ER with commercial support and investment in further development while defending its intellectual property.
    Additionally, Voltaren&reg; Gel, a core product, recovered from a supply disruption in 2012 with strong prescription
    volume and sales growth. Fortesta&reg; Gel, another core product, expanded significantly after gaining improved formulary
    status with several key managed&nbsp;care&nbsp;organizations.
    <br />
    <br />
    The branded pharmaceutical Research and Development team met key project milestones for Aveed&trade; (testosterone
    undecanoate) injectable testosterone replacement therapy as the commercial team fully prepared for the brand's
    recent FDA&nbsp;approval and launch as a treatment for adult men diagnosed with hypogonadism. In addition, branded
    pharmaceutical Research and Development continued to progress the BEMA&reg; buprenorphine program and unveiled
    positive top-line data in early 2014 for the first of two Phase 3 trials. BEMA&reg; buprenorphine is being developed for the
    treatment of moderate to severe chronic pain in patients who are opioid naïve and opioid experienced, and require
    around-the-clock opioid therapy for an extended period&nbsp;of&nbsp;time.<br /><br /></li>
  <li>Qualitest, our generics business, continued to be a strong source of organic growth for our company. In 2013, net sales
    grew 15% primarily as a result of increased volumes; while at the same time operating margins expanded. As a result,
    the business has grown to be the fourth largest United States generic company (IMS EU volume). Strong demand for
    Qualitest's specialty products in controlled substances, liquids and semi solids as well as its broader portfolio of oral dose
    medications continued to drive growth. Additionally, a focus on quality and safety as the cornerstones of a “right first
    time” culture helped to deliver a reliable supply to customers who were in need of high&nbsp;quality, affordable&nbsp;medications.
    <br /><br />Qualitest launched 10 new products and built a robust pipeline that includes 55 Abbreviated New Drug Applications
    (ANDAs) to support future growth. Additionally, Qualitest began the implementation of a $100 million capital investment
    plan to modernize and increase efficiency of the manufacturing facilities to prepare for continued expansion of&nbsp;the&nbsp;business.<br /><br /></li>
  <li>AMS, our medical device business, continued on a path to return to growth with a restructured business approach
    achieving top decile performance in the 2nd half of 2013. In alignment with the lean operating model, AMS installed a
    new leadership team and implemented an organizational structure that is more closely aligned to its customers and is
    intended to foster organizational excellence. In 2013, the business increased profitability nearly three times the rate
    of revenue growth and overall grew 1%, excluding AMS's US Women's Health business. AMS also launched two new
    products – RetroArc&reg; and MiniArc&trade; Pro – and released compelling data from its GOLIATH trial, the first head-to-head
    study demonstrating equal safety and efficacy but faster recovery with its GreenLight XPS&reg; Laser Therapy versus a more
    commonly used treatment for benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). AMS remained committed to physician education,
    training more than 1,400 practitioners on the use of its products, and focused on improving quality of life for nearly
    320,000 patients. The business continued to progress JetTouch&trade; and Topas&reg; as well as successfully completed its first
    audit of its new manufacturing facility&nbsp;in&nbsp;Ireland.</li>
</ul>
<h3>2014 Strategic Imperatives: Our Vision for the Future</h3>
<p> With our new Global Headquarters now established in Dublin, we believe we are poised to deliver on a new vision for Endo:
  to become a leading specialty healthcare company that improves lives while creating value. To accomplish our vision for the
  benefit of patients, customers and our shareholders, we have embraced new guiding principles. We will be more nimble and
  entrepreneurial in our approach to the business. We will be the best managers of our assets, continuing to deliver relevant
  products to the market. We will be efficient acquirers and integrators of new businesses, always acting in a compliant and
  ethical manner in the way we do business, while at the same time staying a step ahead and outperforming&nbsp;our&nbsp;competitors. </p>
<p style="margin-bottom:15px;"> For 2014, we have outlined our strategy for growth:</p>
<ul>
<li>Drive organic growth through our core business</li>
<li>Build upon our new corporate structure</li>
<li>Continued implementation of lean operating model</li>
<li>Complete two to three near-term accretive, value-creating transactions</li>
<li>Increase value of pipeline and launch products</li>
<li>Develop organization and culture</li>
<li>Enhance continued focus on quality, compliance and risk</li>
</ul>
  <p> We believe that the greatest enabler of our strategy is our people, so we will look to retain and recruit the best talent and
    support a performance&nbsp;based&nbsp;culture.</p>
  <p> Through our new vision, guiding principles and execution of our strategy, together with the talented and dedicated
    employees of Endo, we will continue building our company into a leading global specialty healthcare company. I want to
    thank the employees and shareholders for their strong support throughout this past year of change as we engineered the
    company for new growth in 2014 and beyond. I hope you are as excited as I am about the future of&nbsp;our&nbsp;company. </p>
  <p> Sincerely, <br />
