					<h1>Dear Fellow Shareholders</h1>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-sm-12">
					<p><span class="dropcap">O</span><span class="uppercase">n behalf of the entire Ellington team</span>, it is my pleasure to address you once again in our Annual Report to briefly review 2015 performance and share our outlook for 2016. Despite a challenging year that was punctuated by significant turmoil in global credit markets, we managed to generate a 5.2% total compounded return on diluted book value, outperforming the hybrid mortgage REIT group by a wide margin. We were able to accomplish this not only by continuing to focus on careful asset selection, disciplined hedging, and active trading, but also by diversifying our sources of return. In addition, we have continued to deliver book value stability, strong dividends, and superior economic returns per unit of risk compared to the hybrid mortgage REITs. Overall, we have generated an annualized return on diluted book value of 12.2% since our inception in 2007. </p>
<p>Over the past two years, we have actively realigned our business to capitalize on where we see sustainable opportunities, with the unifying theme of filling the vacuum that has been created by the considerable regulatory and market constraints that have been imposed on the banking sector. We have worked hard to build a proprietary pipeline of high-yielding consumer loans, non-QM mortgage loans, and distressed commercial mortgage loans, and not only are these assets performing well for us, but they are kicking into high gear from an overall volume perspective, and are steadily displacing our legacy RMBS assets. By the end of 2015, RMBS represented only 34% of our credit portfolio, down from 82% at the end of 2013. Our goal for 2016 is to continue to ramp up our proprietary pipelines for high-yielding loans, and secure favorable financing facilities for those pipelines, thus building a powerful and predictable earnings stream. We firmly believe that our long history of superior data analytics, our sourcing capabilities, and the flexibility of our partnership structure continue to give us a competitive edge in these markets. Meanwhile, while we have reduced our non-Agency RMBS holdings, we expect to continue to strategically trade this portfolio as market conditions change and opportunities present themselves. </p>
<p>Our hedging and liquidity management strategies continue to be both disciplined and dynamic. Our flexible corporate structure affords us significant advantages, as it allows us to freely invest, hedge, and actively trade our portfolio as we see fit in response to shifting market conditions. This ability to freely hedge our credit and interest rate exposures is more important now than ever. We continue to operate with considerably less leverage than many in our peer group, and towards the end of the year we adopted an even more defensive position by increasing cash and reducing our leverage even further, which we believe has prepared us well for the coming year. While many global credit markets â€” especially those sensitive to energy and commodity prices â€” seem increasingly vulnerable, U.S. households were forced to repair their balance sheets and credit profiles in the aftermath of the financial crisis, and are now in much better shape. In the coming year, the divergence between these large sectors of the credit markets will continue to play a significant role in our credit hedging strategies. With central bank monetary policy diverging globally, as the U.S. Federal Reserve increases short-term interest rates while other central banks drift further into unchartered territory with negative policy rates and expanded QE programs, the future path of long-term interest rates is as unclear as ever, and as a result we will continue to employ a disciplined and dynamic approach to interest rate hedging. </p>
<p>While our portfolio composition is changing, and our focus has shifted from the more single-minded trading of legacy RMBS to a wider array of businesses, our goal at Ellington Financial remains unchanged as we approach our tenth year of operation: to capture upside in good markets and control downside in difficult markets, thereby delivering attractive returns to shareholders over time, without taking excessive risk. Thank you for your continued support and confidence, and we look forward to a successful 2016. </p>

					<p>Sincerely,</p>
					<p>Laurence Penn<br />
