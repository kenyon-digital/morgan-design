					<div class="cols">
					<p><span class="dropcap">O</span><span class="uppercase">n behalf of the entire Ellington team</span>, it is my pleasure to address you once again in our Annual Report to review briefly our 2017 performance and share our outlook for 2018. At Ellington Financial, we have been steadily building a diversified portfolio of loans and securities based on fundamental analysis and proprietary sourcing. While heightened competition for credit assets led to slower-than-planned growth, we still increased our credit portfolio by over 85% in 2017, and our portfolio is now close to targeted levels where it can generate a high, sustainable earnings stream. During this growth phase, we delivered a diluted net asset value-based total return of 6.2% for 2017. Our dividend currently equates to an annualized yield of 10.9% based on our March 19, 2018 closing stock price.</p>

	<p>We achieved many important objectives in 2017 on both the asset and liability side of the balance sheet. On the asset side, our most important loan-oriented strategies—including small balance commercial mortgage loans, consumer loans, non-QM loans, and residential and consumer NPLs—all had excellent performance, and we expect these strategies to generate double-digit returns-on-equity going forward. We are also projecting high returns in our CLO retained interest strategy, which was a new strategy for us in 2017 and appears poised for significant growth in 2018. All of these credit strategies share the common thread of return generation through capturing and leveraging net interest margin, as opposed to price appreciation. As a result, we believe EFC's overall strategy is becoming both more simplified and more predictable.</p>
	<p>On the liability side of the balance sheet, we continued to build the Ellington securitization brand, with Ellington Financial tapping the securitization markets for two new products in 2017. In June, we participated in Ellington's first self-managed CLO, followed by the pricing of a second CLO in December, with more CLOs expected going forward. In November, we completed our inaugural
securitization of non-QM loans, which was well received by both rating agencies
and investors. All of the loans in this securitization were originated by Lendsure
Mortgage, our non-QM loan origination partner in which we hold a strategic
equity investment. We have been continuing to acquire non-QM loans, and are
optimistic that market conditions will support another securitization later this
year. We are enthusiastic about the long-term, locked-in financing that these types
of securitizations provide, with effective costs of funds that are well below the
projected yields on the underlying assets. Importantly, we also expect incremental
funding advantages with each successive securitization that we complete, as
the securitization markets tend to reward repeat issuers with successively better
execution.</p>
<p>In addition to developing our securitization franchise throughout 2017, we also improved, expanded, and diversified our bank financing facilities. We substantially improved terms on our financing facilities for both small balance commercial mortgage loans and consumer loans, and established additional financing facilities for non-QM loans, residential NPLs, and consumer loans.</p>
<p>Another milestone we achieved in 2017 was the successful completion of our first issuance of unsecured debt. We issued $86 million in senior unsecured notes, rated single-A by Egan-Jones, with a five-year maturity and a fixed rate of 5.25%. We were very pleased with the execution of the offering, which we believe represents among the lowest costs of funds in our peer group for long-term unsecured non-convertible debt. The notes provide us with another source of long-term non-mark-to-market financing, particularly for our harder-to-finance assets, and further diversify our balance sheet.</p>

<p>With our share price trading at a significant discount to book value, we have been capitalizing on attractive opportunities to repurchase our shares. Throughout 2017, we repurchased 961,566 shares for $14.6 million, gaining 11 cents of accretion to diluted book value per share. Since year end, we have repurchased over 3% more of our outstanding shares, and our Board of Directors has reloaded our repurchase program to accommodate additional repurchases. Even though we are seeing attractive assets coming out of our loan pipelines, stock buybacks have been a compelling use of capital, particularly given where our stock price has been in recent months. At these levels, stock buybacks have provided substantial accretion to book value per share, which should ultimately lead to both meaningful accretion to earnings per share and a higher stock price.</p>

<p>We have also been actively evaluating the potential actions we may take in response to the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, including enhancements to our investment strategies and possible conversion to a taxable corporation.</p>
<p>Looking forward, given the volatility we have seen in 2018 so far, we believe that staying true to our acquisition standards, continuing to employ a disciplined hedging strategy, and otherwise prudently managing risk, are as important now as ever. We are optimistic about our strategies and are forecasting that our credit portfolio will be fully ramped by the middle part of this year. The new year is off to a very strong start, with estimated book value per share, dividend-adjusted, up over 3% year-to-date through February.</p>
<p>Thank you for your continued support and confidence, and we look forward to a successful 2018.</p>

					<p>Sincerely,</p>
