					<h1>Dear Fellow Shareholders:</h1>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-sm-6">
					<p>2013 was an exciting year for the Company, and on behalf of our entire team, I’d like to welcome our new shareholders to Ellington Residential Mortgage REIT.</p>
			
					<p>We are confident that there are, and always will be, excellent opportunities in the residential mortgage market. We created Ellington Residential Mortgage REIT to provide investors with a tax-efficient, publicly traded vehicle to take advantage of these opportunities while leveraging Ellington’s substantial experience and robust infrastructure.</p>
					
					<p>Our objective is to generate attractive returns in these highly complex markets by combining research-driven security selection with active trading and hedging, rather than just taking a buy-and-hold approach. The vast majority of our portfolio is currently comprised of Agency residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS), with non-Agency RMBS completing our holdings. Our strategies are executed by a team with deep experience and a proven track record in the mortgage market, including extensive expertise in prepayment, interest rate and credit modeling. Our senior management team has an average of over 25 years of mortgage-related experience. We are also privileged to have the support of the Blackstone Group as co-founding shareholder.</p>
			
					<p>In May of last year, just days after the pricing of our IPO, we entered the worst bear market in Agency RMBS in years, with the 10-year Treasury yield rising over 80% in the ensuing four months. However, by sticking to our core principles, including remaining disciplined about hedging and rebalancing our hedges across the entire yield curve throughout these extreme interest rate movements, we were able to significantly outperform our Agency mortgage REIT peers, many of whom were forced to sell down their positions precipitously to reduce leverage and risk. In our Agency portfolio, we took advantage of the dislocations by adding to our higher coupon holdings, which we believed to be meaningfully oversold. In our non-Agency portfolio, we invested in seasoned subprime and Alt-A, believing that these offered good relative value and complemented our Agency holdings.</p>
			
					<p>Our performance through a challenging environment in 2013 supports our contention that there is no single investment strategy that will be successful all the time in the U.S. mortgage market. We firmly believe that our flexible mandate, our trading mentality, and our extensive research capabilities and market experience, combined with our disciplined hedging strategy and focus on risk management, set us apart.</p>
			
					<p>Looking forward, we continue to see tremendous opportunities in both the Agency and non-Agency RMBS markets. In the Agency RMBS market, as the Federal Reserve gradually steps back from its dominant position, it will be capital from the private sector — including Ellington Residential Mortgage REIT — that will take advantage of the resulting void. In the non-Agency RMBS market, we remain positive in our outlook, both on fundamental and technical grounds, and continue to see tremendous opportunities. On the fundamental side, we expect that solid home price appreciation will continue to provide significant support for the prices and credit performance of non-Agency RMBS. On the technical side, while the GSEs and large banks continue to sell non-Agency RMBS from their portfolios, market appetite for these assets remains quite strong, especially among insurance companies, regional banks, and money managers. In both Agency and non-Agency RMBS, we will once again use our experience and expertise to try to capture the upside in good markets, while controlling the downside in tough markets.</p>
			
					<p>Our goals for Ellington Residential Mortgage REIT remain unchanged. We are committed to delivering an attractive dividend yield over market cycles while mitigating risk, and in so doing to generate outstanding returns for our shareholders. Your investment in Ellington Residential Mortgage REIT is supported by some of the most extensive infrastructure, analytics, and portfolio management experience in the MBS sector.</p>
			
					<p>Thank you again for your continued support and confidence as we work toward a successful 2014.</p>
			
					<p>Sincerely,</p>
