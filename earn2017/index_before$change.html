					<h1>Dear Fellow Shareholders:</h1>

	<p><span class="dropcap">O</span><span class="uppercase">n behalf of the entire Ellington team</span>, it is my pleasure to address you once again in
  our Annual Report to review 2017 performance briefly and share our outlook for 2018. This
  past year proved to be one of the least volatile years for interest rates on record, despite three
  Federal Reserve interest rate hikes, a new administration in Washington, significant geopolitical
  uncertainties, and the first pullback in quantitative easing in a decade. Long-term interest rates
  remained range-bound, while the yield curve consistently flattened each quarter throughout the year.
  Given the calmness of last year's markets, our defensive positioning somewhat muted our results in
  2017, but should set us up well for 2018, which is shaping
  up to be a much more volatile environment. For 2017, our
  core earnings comfortably covered our dividends, and we
  generated a return on average equity of 6.2%. Based on our
  March 19, 2018 closing price, our current annualized
  dividend represents an attractive yield of 13.0%. </p><figure>

  </figure>
<p> EARN's dynamic hedging strategy is designed above all to
  protect book value and preserve capital. To better match the
  characteristics of our mortgage assets, we position our
  interest rate hedges along the entire yield curve, leaving us
  with less exposure to changes in the shape of the yield curve.
  Our hedges include substantial TBA short positions, which
  not only reduce the amount of hedge rebalancing needed
  when interest rates move sharply, but also leave us carrying a lower net mortgage exposure than our
  Agency mortgage REIT peers. </p>
<p> Despite the record low volatility and low prepayment expectations, we maintained our hedging
  discipline during 2017 because we recognize that volatility can return to the market at any time. We
  don't mind spending a little on portfolio insurance in complacent markets when it means that we can
  outperform in more hostile environments. Let's not forget that it was only a little over a year ago,
  during the fourth quarter of 2016, that we saw a sudden spike in interest rates following the
  presidential election. At that time, EARN was the only company in its peer group with a positive
  economic return for the quarter. Thus far this year, we have
  certainly seen volatility return to the markets, and we look
  forward to the trading opportunities that we believe will
  emerge as a result of this increased volatility. </p><figure>
 <img src="assets/images/federal-reserve.jpg" alt="federal-reserve" width="850" height="567">

  </figure>
<p> During the nearly five years since our initial public offering
  in May 2013, we have always strived to be patient stewards
  of shareholders' capital. In the second quarter of 2017, we
  completed our first follow-on equity offering, successfully
  raising about $45 million in new capital. While the offering
  was modestly dilutive to book value per share, this was more
  than outweighed by the beneficial effects of a larger capital
  base, which substantially reduced our annualized expense
  ratio, and should be significantly accretive to earnings.
  Shareholders gained a major boost to liquidity from the issuance, as we increased our tradable float by
  over 50%. Our increased float and market capitalization also triggered EARN's inclusion in the Russell
  3000 Index, which should increase demand for our shares and serve as an important source of ongoing
  technical support. </p><figure>

</figure>
<p> In 2017, we also established an at-the-market (ATM) program for our common shares, which we used
  opportunistically to raise an additional $14 million in equity, further increasing the liquidity of our
  shares and lowering our expense ratio. Our ATM program allows us to raise smaller increments of
  capital in a highly cost-effective manner when market conditions are favorable. </p>
<p> As we look back on 2017, the protracted period of unusual calm in the markets rewarded high risktaking.
  As such, our interest rate hedging strategy—which is designed to protect us from market shocks
  —ended up dampening our performance. However, we believe that this hedging strategy positions us
  well for 2018. Later this year, the Federal Reserve is expected to accelerate its balance sheet tapering
  and substantially raise short-term interest rates, and many other central banks are expected to withdraw
  stimulus for the first time in a decade. This combination of factors could put significant upward
  pressure on both overall interest rates and Agency RMBS yield spreads. </p>
  <figure>
<img src="assets/images/freddie-mac.jpg" alt="freddie-mac" width="850" height="567">
<figcaption>Freddie Mac

</figure>

<p> We see many reasons for caution, and indeed we have
  already witnessed rising bond yields and sharply higher
  equity volatility so far this year. Thanks to our flexible and
  resilient portfolio management style—including our
  disciplined and dynamic hedging strategy and the high
  liquidity of our portfolio—we believe that we are wellpositioned
  to capitalize on the investment opportunities that
  should emerge in the new market dynamic. Finally, with our
  stock price at a significant discount to book value, we plan
  to supplement our earnings with book value accretion via
  share repurchases. </p>
  <p> We view EARN as an &quot;all-weather&quot; REIT, able to thrive
  across diverse market environments, and generate attractive
  risk-adjusted returns for shareholders over the long term. The future path of interest rates is impacted
  by multiple factors, many of which are impossible to predict. Therefore, rather than having a singleminded
  view of what the future will hold, we try to construct and manage our portfolios to perform
  over a wide range of potential economic scenarios. We look forward to the challenges of the year ahead
  and the opportunities we believe they will bring. </p>
<p> Thank you again for your continued support and confidence, and we look forward to a successful
  2018. </p>
