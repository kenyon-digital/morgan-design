					<h1>Dear Fellow Shareholders:</h1>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-sm-12">
					<p><span class="dropcap">O</span><span class="uppercase">n behalf of the entire Ellington team</span>, it is my pleasure to address you once again in our Annual Report and briefly review our 2014 performance and share our outlook for 2015.</p>
<p>In 2014, we generated a 9.4% total compounded economic return on diluted book value by keeping to our fundamental approach, which is to employ careful asset selection, disciplined hedging, and active trading. As asset yields declined over the course of the year, we did not respond by adding leverage or undue risk. Instead, we augmented our returns by turning over our portfolio to generate trading gains and take advantage of relative value opportunities. Our 2014 performance relative to our peers was consistent with our more conservative portfolio construction, as we tend to be less leveraged and more hedged than many of our peers. We believe this to be the best long-term strategy to preserve book value and generate consistent returns over market cycles, and by executing this strategy we have delivered an average annual economic return on book value of 13.2% since our inception in 2007.</p>
<p>Coming into 2014, one of our primary goals was to continue to diversify our portfolio and widen our scope to access investment opportunities in a broad range of adjacent sectors. We succeeded in this regard – we greatly increased the size of our CLO and European portfolios and started ramping up investments in mortgage originators, consumer ABS and loans, and distressed corporate debt. We believe that Ellington’s expertise in data analytics and loan-level modeling gives us competitive advantages in many of these sectors. We are now positioned to invest in a wide variety of asset classes, enabling us to be nimble and opportunistic in our capital allocation as sectors fall in and out of favor.</p>
<p>To enable us to take further advantage of opportunities in this broad array of targeted asset classes, we executed a capital raise in September 2014 and issued eight million new shares, generating net proceeds of $188 million. We also bolstered our capital structure by establishing a $150 million non-mark-to-market borrowing facility for our non-Agency portfolio during the third quarter; this facility is now fully drawn.</p>
<p>Our moves into these new sectors share a unifying theme: significant vacuums have been created in many areas of the investment and lending markets, largely because the new regulatory and market environment limits banks’ ability to participate in them. For example, with the decline in trading and proprietary desk activity at the large investment banks, we are finding compelling opportunities to actively trade and monetize inefficiencies in non-Agency RMBS, and we believe this will continue to be a meaningful source of profits for us. </p>
<p>As we enter 2015, we believe that we are well positioned to capture additional sources of revenue and scale many of our newer strategies, where we are already seeing significant potential for attractive risk-adjusted returns. Thanks to our externally managed structure, we can avail ourselves of the additional resources required to implement these strategies in a highly efficient manner. We’re excited to launch our non-QM mortgage loan acquisition program, which has the potential to create opportunities for a long time to come. We also expect to continue to grow our consumer ABS and loan business, including establishing additional flow agreements with more originators, and involving a broader product line. Mortgage and consumer credit availability continues to be overly constrained, creating an opportunity for responsible lenders to extend credit to many worthy borrowers who are currently shut out of the market. Over time, we expect that these strategies will make more significant contributions to our returns.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, we’re always mindful of the potential for increased interest rate volatility, which we’ve already seen in early 2015, and therefore we will continue to employ a disciplined and dynamic hedging strategy. The flexibility provided by our partnership structure offers a significant advantage as it allows us to freely invest, hedge, and actively trade our portfolio as we see fit in response to shifting market conditions. While it’s generally expected that the Federal Reserve will increase short-term interest rates later this year, this may have some surprising consequences and lead to dislocations in a variety of markets.  With our low leverage and disciplined interest rate hedging, we believe that we’ll be ready to capitalize on the opportunities that may emerge in the many different markets in which we’re now active.</p>
<p>As we approach our eight-year anniversary, our goal remains the same: to capture upside in good markets and to control downside in difficult markets, and in so doing to deliver attractive returns and dividends to shareholders over time, without taking outsized risks. Thank you again for your continued support and confidence, and we look forward to a successful 2015.</p>

					<p>Sincerely,</p>
					<p>Laurence Penn<br />
