					<h1>Dear Fellow Shareholders:</h1>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-sm-12">
					<div class="cols">
					<p><span class="dropcap">O</span><span class="uppercase">n behalf of the entire Ellington team</span>, it is my pleasure to address you once again in our Annual Report to briefly review 2016 performance and share our outlook for 2017. In 2016, our assets performed well, driven by solid performance and continued growth in our loan businesses. However, losses on our high-yield corporate credit hedges, which were principally used to hedge our non-Agency RMBS assets, proved to be a substantial drag on earnings, resulting in overall performance that fell short of our expectations. While disappointed with our performance for the last year, we are very optimistic about our prospects for 2017 and beyond. </p>
<img src="assets/images/capitol_building.jpg" alt="The Capitol Building" />
<p>Over the course of 2016, our goal was to build a more predictable earnings stream by continuing to grow our pipelines of high-yielding loan assets, and by securing favorable financing facilities for those pipelines. Since executing our first financing facility for small balance commercial mortgage loans in early 2016, we have subsequently added facilities for non-QM mortgage loans, residential non-performing loans, and consumer loans. </p>
<img src="assets/images/fanniemae.jpg" alt="Fannie Mae Corporate Headquarters" />
<p>We started 2016 with a hedging strategy that reflected our concern that the credit markets â€” and especially the high-yield corporate bond markets â€” were vulnerable to a variety of possible risks, such as an economic downturn, tightening of monetary policy, or weakening commodity or energy prices. While we did see two large sell-offs in the credit markets during the year â€” the first following the steep plunge in commodity prices that culminated early in the year, and the second after the Brexit vote later in the year â€” in both cases heavy central bank interventions caused strong relief rallies and ultimately led to losses on our high-yield corporate bond hedges. As continued accommodative monetary policies of global central banks pushed yields on sovereign bonds lower during the first three quarters of 2016, investors sought higher yields from other sectors, including the high-yield corporate bond market where our hedges were concentrated. </p>
<p>As the year progressed, we significantly reduced the size of our non-Agency RMBS portfolio, and we observed continued de-coupling between the non-Agency RMBS market and the high-yield corporate bond market. In response, we substantially scaled back our high-yield corporate credit hedges during the third and fourth quarters, and by the end of the year our portfolio was far less exposed to the performance of these hedges. </p>
<img src="assets/images/freddiemac.jpg" alt="The Federal Reserve Building" />
<p>With our high-yield corporate credit hedges no longer a significant factor in our portfolio, we are very enthusiastic about the outlook for our business and future growth â€” we see no shortage of opportunities to put our capital to work. We continue to see excellent opportunities in our consumer loan business, our small balance commercial mortgage loan business (both distressed loans and bridge loans), our non-QM loan business, and our non-performing residential loan business. In addition, we are exploring CLO-related opportunities for our corporate loan portfolio. </p>
<p>As we entered 2017 our credit portfolio had an average unleveraged yield of over 10.5%, and we were using only very modest leverage. Over the coming months, we plan to increase the size of our credit portfolio by judiciously adding both assets and leverage. Notably, as we continue to ramp up our loan pipelines, we now have the flexibility to allocate between a wide variety of strategies that we believe will generate high returns on capital, while continuing to increase our capacity for these strategies using both our financing facilities and the securitization markets. With a larger portfolio of high-yielding loan assets, we expect to produce a high, sustainable earnings stream. Although there are many components to our loan portfolios, our overall strategy is becoming more simplified, given that the common thread of our loan businesses is capturing and leveraging net interest margin.</p>
<img src="assets/images/federal_reserve.jpg" alt="The Federal Reserve Building" />
<p>Despite what was a difficult year, Ellington Financial's historical performance remains strong. Since our inception in 2007, we have generated an average annualized return on diluted book value of 10.6%. Given our growing pipelines of high-yielding loan assets, coupled with the leverage we can apply with our financing facilities and through the securitization markets, we believe that we will soon be well positioned to consistently generate earnings to cover our quarterly dividend, which currently equates to an annualized yield of 11.4% based on our March 17, 2017 closing stock price.</p>
<p>After nearly a decade of operation, our goal at Ellington Financial remains the same: to capture upside in good markets and control downside in difficult markets, thereby delivering attractive returns to shareholders over time, without taking excessive risk. </p>
<p>Thank you for your continued support and confidence, and we look forward to a successful 2017.</p>

					<p>Sincerely,</p>
					<p>Laurence Penn<br />
