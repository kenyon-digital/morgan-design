	<p><span class="dropcap">O</span><span class="uppercase">n behalf of the entire Ellington team</span>, it is my pleasure to address you once again in our Annual Report to briefly review 2016 performance and share our outlook for 2017. We are pleased with the strong performance Ellington Residential achieved in 2016, particularly given the challenges presented by heightened interest rate volatility. For the full year, we achieved a compounded economic return of 8.7%, and our core earnings comfortably covered our dividends. Our annualized dividend currently represents a yield of 11.0% based on our March 17, 2017 closing price.</p>

  <p>
  Our performance for the year was especially strong in comparison to other Agency mortgage REITs, which on average had a compounded economic return for the year of only 1.3%. Our outperformance was particularly notable in the fourth quarter, with our +1.4% economic return, while every other Agency mortgage REIT had a negative economic return, with a -5.7% economic return on average.</p>
   <img src="assets/images/capitol_building.jpg" alt="The Capitol Building" />
<p class="caption">The Capitol Building</p>
  <p>
  The volatility in interest rates was historic in 2016, with both the 10-year and 30-year U.S. Treasury yields plummeting to all-time record low levels in July, only to surge in the fourth quarter in one of the largest quarterly increases ever. In response, the Mortgage Bankers Association Refinance Index reached a multi-year high on July 8, 2016, only to decline by over 50% during the fourth quarter, and fall back to its lowest level since the financial crisis by year end. </p>

<p class="caption">The Federal Reserve Building</p>

<p>Despite these dramatic gyrations in interest rates and prepayment rates, Ellington Residential adapted and thrived throughout the year. Our performance in 2016 is a testament to our model-driven asset selection and disciplined hedging strategy, as it was our careful portfolio construction that successfully shielded our portfolio despite 2016's headwinds. In the falling and ultimately ultra-low interest rate environment of the first nine months of the year, our specified pools showed remarkable resilience against prepayments. Then, in the surging rate environment of the last part of the year, our TBA hedges helped protect us against what was otherwise a bloodbath in Agency RMBS. Our willingness to use significant amounts of TBA short positions in our hedging strategy is one of our most effective tools, and was a major contributor to book value preservation in 2016. Notably, our use of TBA short positions differentiates us from most other Agency mortgage REITs; only a few others use TBAs at all as hedges, and those that do, have used them on a much smaller scale. </p>

<p>Our objective since our inception remains unchanged: to generate attractive, risk-adjusted returns by combining research-driven security selection with active trading and hedging, rather than by just taking a buy-and-hold approach. We seek to capture upside in good markets and control downside in difficult ones. In 2016, we clearly demonstrated that this objective is not merely a slogan, and we believe that we continue to be uniquely qualified to achieve this objective over market cycles.</p>

<p class="caption">Fannie Mae Corporate Headquarters</p>

<p>The future path of interest rates is impacted by multiple factors, many of which are impossible to predict. Therefore, instead of having a single-minded view of what the future will hold, we try to construct and manage our portfolios to perform over a wide range of potential economic scenarios. In 2017, we will continue to execute our strategy in what could be an extended period of heightened interest rate volatility. The new administration's policies are likely to have a significant impact on government spending, housing, and the financial markets. Additionally, in the near term, we should start to see the Federal Reserve's footprint in the Agency RMBS market contract further, as slower prepayments reduce its principal reinvestments. The Federal Reserve could even discontinue its policy of reinvesting the billions of principal payments it receives each month, or perhaps even sell down its portfolio outright, either of which would carry great significance for the Agency RMBS market. Today's uncertainties make it essential to have an adaptable strategy in place. Fortunately, we do, and are poised and ready to adapt and capitalize on the market opportunities that often arise out of such uncertainty. </p>

 <p>
  Some have said that Agency mortgage REITs cannot succeed — and in fact aren't even designed to succeed — when interest rates are rising and the yield curve is flattening. We vehemently disagree that this view applies to Ellington Residential. We believe that 2016 demonstrates our unique ability to succeed — and even thrive — in market environments where others might struggle.</p>
<p>Thank you again for your continued support and confidence, and we look forward to a successful 2017.</p>
