					<h1>Dear Fellow Shareholders:</h1>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-sm-12">
					<p><span class="dropcap">O</span><span class="uppercase">n behalf of the entire Ellington team</span>, it is my pleasure to address you in our second Annual Report and briefly review our 2014 performance and share our outlook for 2015.</p>
<p>Ellington Residential Mortgage REIT delivered consistently strong core earnings each quarter and realized a compounded return on average equity of 9.9% for the full year, despite another challenging year for fixed income markets. Looking back over the nearly two-year period since our IPO in May 2013, we are extremely pleased with our performance relative to the Agency mortgage REIT peer group on a total economic return basis (dividends paid plus change in book value). We increased our quarterly dividend at the beginning of 2014 and have maintained it at that level, as it continues to be comfortably covered by our core earnings.</p>
<p>Our objective remains unchanged: we seek to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns by utilizing an opportunistic approach to investing in our targeted assets. Our goal is to capture upside in good markets and control downside in difficult markets. We do this by combining research-driven security selection with active trading and disciplined interest rate hedging, rather than just taking a buy-and-hold approach. We try to construct and manage our portfolios to perform over a range of potential economic scenarios, as opposed to having a single-minded view of the future direction of interest rates, which are notoriously difficult to predict.</p>
<p>2014 is a prime example of the market’s unpredictability. At the outset of the year, under the assumption that the Federal Reserve would move toward a more normalized monetary policy as economic conditions continued to improve, many market participants were forecasting that long-term interest rates would rise during the year. Instead, long-term interest rates fell dramatically over the course of the year, with the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield declining by 86 basis points. Nevertheless, our portfolio positioning, together with a significant amount of active trading, enabled us to achieve solid financial results for the year, while never losing our focus on risk control. Notably, our results were supported by positive contributions from both our Agency and non-Agency portfolios, demonstrating our ability to leverage Ellington’s substantial breadth and expertise within the mortgage markets.</p>
<p>We entered 2014 cautiously optimistic about mortgage markets, but concerned that the market was underestimating the potential for interest rate volatility, increases in prepayments, and government policy shocks. In the Agency market, we believed that specified pools would outperform TBAs in a volatile interest rate environment, and in the non-Agency market, we believed that steadily improving fundamentals in the housing market would drive strong returns. As the year progressed and the market continued to downplay potential prepayment risk, we maintained the weighting in our Agency portfolio toward specified pools with favorable prepayment characteristics and with less exposure to changes in government policy. Meanwhile, we maintained our
roughly 15% capital allocation to
non-Agency RMBS, which continued
to perform well and where we identified
numerous relative value
opportunities throughout the year.</p>
<p>The Federal Reserve completed its
  tapering of quantitative easing in 2014,
  but other market participants have
  readily absorbed the incremental
  supply of Agency RMBS. While our
  Agency and non-Agency assets performed
  well overall in 2014, a swift
  decline in interest rates in the fourth
  quarter, combined with persistent
  strength in the TBA roll market, caused
  our assets to underperform relative to
  our hedges, resulting in a modest drag
  on our performance at year end. While
  low levels of interest rate volatility and
  a benign prepayment environment
  characterized most of 2014, volatility
  increased significantly during the
  fourth quarter and has remained
elevated so far in 2015.</p>
<p>Looking forward, while interest rate
  risk, prepayment risk, and government
  policy risk each present distinct
  challenges, we believe that substantial
  shocks in any category would likely
  bring numerous dislocations and
  thereby many opportunities for us. We
  can be nimble given our size, which
  should make it easier for us to reposition
  our portfolio quickly to take
  advantage of opportunities that may
  suddenly arise, especially in sectors that
  have historically been prone to periodic
  severe dislocations, such as the IO
  (interest-only) sectors. With the
  10-year U.S. Treasury yield dropping
  below 2% at a time when the government
  mortgage agencies are making
  refinancing substantially easier for
  many borrowers, these dislocations
may not be far off. In the meantime, we will continue to employ a disciplined
yet dynamic hedging strategy, as
we believe that managing for a range of
outcomes is the best way to simultaneously
drive shareholder returns and
preserve book value.</p>
<p>It already looks like 2015 will be
  another exciting year in the mortgage
  markets, offering a number of opportunities
  that we believe will enable us to
  continue to generate attractive risk-adjusted
  returns. Thank you again for
  your continued support and confidence,
  and we look forward to a
successful year.</p>

					<p>Sincerely,</p>
