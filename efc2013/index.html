					<p class="sans">1-Year Housing Affordability Decline is defined as the decline in housing affordability between December 2012 and December 2013 in each ZIP code. Housing affordability measures annual housing debt service costs (based on a 30-year fixed rate 80 LTV loan) as a fraction of median annual household income. Housing affordability in Metro Orlando, FL declined on average by 23.6% from December 2012 to December 2013. Significant declines in housing affordability may present an obstacle to further home price appreciation.</p>

					<h1>Dear Fellow Shareholders:</h1>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-sm-12">
					<p>On behalf of the entire Ellington team, it is my pleasure to address you once again in our Annual Report, and I would like to take this opportunity to briefly review our 2013 performance and to share our outlook for 2014.</p>
					
					<p>While 2013 was an exceptionally turbulent year for the fixed income markets, Ellington Financial delivered a solid return on average equity of 13.4%. Yet again, both our non-Agency and Agency strategies were profitable in 2013. Within our non-Agency strategy, while asset yields were considerably lower than they had been in 2012, we were able to take advantage of many trading opportunities. We turned over 73% of our non-Agency portfolio, rotating our purchases and sales between securities and sectors to take advantage of shifting relative value. In addition to augmenting our returns, active trading also helped us to diversify. Specifically, we increased our holdings of non-performing residential loans, “B-pieces” of CMBS, distressed small balance commercial mortgage loans, CLOs, and European RMBS. Just one year ago, our holdings in these sectors were either much smaller relative to our overall portfolio, or nonexistent. While we believe that ample opportunities remain in the non-Agency RMBS market, where we generated most of our profits in 2012 and 2013, we believe that these other non-Agency sectors also offer attractive investing and trading opportunities. Moreover, our infrastructure, analytical tools, and experience readily support these other sectors, and position us to capitalize on opportunities there in 2014 and beyond.</p>
			
					<p>Although the vast majority of our 2013 income was generated from our non-Agency strategy, we are particularly pleased that our Agency strategy also delivered positive performance on a fully mark-to-market basis. Across the industry, 2013 was an extremely difficult year for Agency RMBS investing, especially with interest rates rising so precipitously in the late spring. Nevertheless, with our disciplined approach to managing interest rate risk and liquidity, we were able to control volatility without having to deleverage. In fact, when other market participants were selling assets to reduce risk during the turmoil, we were able to add assets at levels that, in our view, were as attractive as we had seen in quite some time.</p>
			
					<p>Throughout the year we kept to our fundamental approach in both strategies, which is to employ careful asset selection, disciplined hedging, and active trading. As you know, our flexible PTP structure allows us to invest, hedge, and actively trade our portfolio as we see fit.</p>
			
					<p>Looking ahead, we expect that active trading and further asset diversification will be key aspects of our non-Agency strategy throughout 2014. We expect to benefit as banks, HUD, the GSEs and others continue to liquidate distressed assets that were originated before the financial crisis. We are particularly excited about the potential for increased supply — and therefore increased investment opportunities — in the residential non-performing loan market (where HUD continues to be a heavy seller) and in the market for European MBS and ABS. Since implementation of the new regulatory framework for European banks is imminent, we believe that this will result in markedly increased sales by European banks of their distressed assets, including residential and commercial mortgage loans, MBS, and ABS.</p>
			
					<p>Additionally, with the Federal Reserve expected to continue to withdraw its support from the bond market, we are optimistic that 2014 will be a fruitful year for us. The future of the GSEs continues to be debated vigorously, and we continue to believe that private capital will ultimately displace government capital as the primary bearer of credit risk, interest rate risk, and prepayment risk in the mortgage market. As this happens, Ellington Financial will be presented with both compelling opportunities and new challenges. As we approach our seven-year anniversary, our goal remains the same: to capture upside in good markets and to control downside in difficult markets, and in so doing to deliver attractive returns and dividends to shareholders over time, without taking outsized risks.</p>
			
					<p>Thank you again for your continued support and confidence, and we look forward to a successful 2014.</p>
					
					<p>Sincerely,</p>
